- version 0.7, commit 481aed80e3a0470a2dcbd75f503450077f70c360
   Revamped the scaling of the gear. This hopefully fixes #5 #14 
   My silly metric_hack is no longer needed.

- commit c72cf73ce7 
  Issue: a 6 tooth gear had its gaps very shallow below the pitch circle.
  Fixed computation of accuracy_circular, was always -1 with my automatic setting.
  Now the low tooth count gears look great again.

- extended_ranges.patch added
  max. 360 teeth was too low for 366 outer wheel of an astrolabium.
- selectable_accuracy.patch
  high accuracy of involute is not needed with large tooth counts.
  It just gets extremly slow. Allow lowered settings.
- metric_module.patch
  Add an option to select metric units system and module, instead
  of circular pitch.

- an improvement over the original inkscape extension gears
  It adds holes to the gear (central hole for the shaft and some radial holes
  to make gear lighter).

  * More accurate tooth profile. In earlier versions the involute curve was
    approximated by only three points; now by 15 (can be modified in the source code)
  * Center cross (easy for aligning); off by default, can be turned on
  * Pitch circle (easy for meshing; circles should touch for meshing gears);
    off by defalut can be turned on
  * Info: in the SVG there is now an extra field telling a little about the
    gear (easy if you want to make a meshing gear but you forgot the settings used)
